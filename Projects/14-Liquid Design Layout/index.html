                <h2>Book Description</h2>

                <p>
                    Modern Operating Systems incorporates the latest developments and technologies in operating systems (OS) technologies. Author Andy Tanenbaum's clear and entertaining writing style outlines the concepts every OS designer needs to master. In-depth topic coverage includes processes, threads, memory management, file systems, I/O, deadlocks, interface design, multimedia, performance tradeoffs, and trends in OS design. Case studies explore popular OS and provide real-world context. Tanenbaum also provides information on current research based on his experience as an operating systems researcher.

                    The 5th Edition keeps pace with modern OS with a new chapter on Windows 11, new security coverage, an emphasis on flash-based solid-state drives and more.

                <h2>Book Contents</h2>
                <p>The content of this book is structured into thirteen distinct sections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="one">provides an overview of operating systems, defining their role as the primary interface between hardware and software. It introduces the fundamental objectives of an operating system: resource management, process scheduling, memory allocation, security, and providing abstractions that simplify application development. The introduction also explains the evolution of operating systems, from early batch systems to modern cloud-based environments.</li>
                    <li class="two">explains how an operating system manages processes, which are running instances of programs. It distinguishes between processes (independent units of execution with their own memory space) and threads (lightweight units of execution that share the same memory).</li>
                    <li class="three">discusses how operating systems allocate and manage memory resources. It begins with the distinction between physical and virtual memory, then covers:</li>
